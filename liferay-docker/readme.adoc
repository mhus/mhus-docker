This docker project is a fork of https://github.com/liferay/liferay-docker. It will execute the
build process in a separate docker image. So the build of the liferay image is independent of
the installed java version.

Start the create script with the url to the liferay package

----

./create files.liferay.com/private/ee/portal/7.2.10/liferay-dxp-tomcat-7.2.10-ga1-20190531140450482.7z

----

It's also possible to give a file in the user home. You have to set the relative path from user home. The script will
mount the user home and try to use the file.

----

./create.sh Shared/Liferay/liferay-ce-portal-tomcat-7.0-ga4-20170613175008905.zip

----

Will create a liferay with base file in `/home/user/Shared/Liferay/liferay-ce-portal-tomcat-7.0-ga4-20170613175008905.zip`.
